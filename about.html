                        <p><a name="id380362"><!--anchor--></a>SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
                        asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from
                        the beginning to the end, <a href="#">keeping nothing back</a> but the bearings of the
                        island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I
                        take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when
                        my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
                        sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
                        <p><a name="id380370"><!--anchor--></a>I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the
                        inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a
                        tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the
                        shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
                        black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
                        white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself
                        as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so
                        often afterwards:</p>
                        <p><a name="id380380"><!--anchor--></a>in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and
                        broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of
                        stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,
                        called roughly for a glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him,
                        he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still
                        looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.</p>
                        <p><a name="id380387"><!--anchor--></a>"This is a handy cove," says he at length; "and a pleasant sittyated
                        grog-shop. Much company, mate?"</p>
                        <p><a name="id380391"><!--anchor--></a>My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.</p>
                        <p><a name="id380395"><!--anchor--></a>"Well, then," said he, "this is the berth for me. Here you, matey," he
                        cried to the man who trundled the barrow; "bring up alongside and help
                        up my chest. I'll stay here a bit," he continued. "I'm a plain man; rum
                        and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch
                        ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I
                        see what you're at—there"; and he threw down three or four gold pieces
                        on the threshold. "You can tell me when I've worked through that," says
                        he, looking as fierce as a commander.</p>
